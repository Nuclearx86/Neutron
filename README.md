# Neutron
Neutron is an advanced text editor that aims to make editing text more convenient, customisable, and visually appealing.

Based on the Electron Node.js framework, this application makes usage of HTML, CSS and Javascrpt in order to supply you with a simple but feature rich interface, all running in a local instance of Chromium, allowing you to get the best of both desktop and web applications.

Our goal is to provide our users with a highly functional, open-source program that they can trust. All of the code behind Neutron is public facing and publicly accessible, and the only difference between what you see in our repository and our published packages is that one of them is compiled and one is not.
