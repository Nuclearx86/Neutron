# Neutron
Neutron is an advanced text editor that aims to make editing text more convenient, customisable, and visually appealing.

Built upon Java, this application makes usage of Java's extensive GUI database in order to supply you with a simple but feature rich interface, all running from the convinience of your desktop.

Our goal is to provide our users with a highly functional, open-source program that you can trust. All of the code behind Neutron is public facing and publicly accessible, and the only difference between what you see in our repository and our published packages is that one of them is compiled and one is not.
